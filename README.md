# Structured Living
Many indiviuduals struggle to manage their life by directing their time, energy and attention where it really matters and especially the areas of their life that they want to blossom in abundance. It is believed by many of the 'successful' people who achieved much in their life, that dedicating quality time everyday working and progressing towards a goal or an objective that you deem important in your life, creates a life of meaning and bountiful fulfillment that absolutely no  action or substance of instant pleasure can ever hope to bring you.

This project aims to achieve this by providing a desktop application which one can use to track their goals and the daily habits they need to indulge in to reach them.

Who is the project intended to serve:
For the all rounder individuals who need to create balance between their work and home life, and making time for the projects or goals they always "hoped" to achieve for themselves, but haven't _yet_ made it a discipline in their life to taking regular action towards their deepest goals.
