        <h3>About - What inspired the creation of this project</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          So as with many young adolescents, from childhood I had neglected the
          practise of building good, strong habits that encouraged the
          development of my personal growth and self care. I instead directed
          most of my time and attention towards easier methods of enjoyment such
          as video games and binge watching TV shows. I had not been instilled
          with much responsibility, discipline and the ability to control my
          continuous influx of thoughts which gradually increased as I aged and
          become extremely difficult to manage and control especially when I had
          unintentionally, developed bad habits and a weak-willed mindset which
          casually, always prioritised ease and pleasure over confronting and
          overcoming the challenge at hand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It sent me into a cycle of emptiness and depression that continued to
          haunt me in my high school years. That is, until I found the concept
          of "self-improvement". Trying to continually develop and live as the
          best version of myself and cut that image of me who indulged in a
          worthless activities that encouraged my decline instead of my growth.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to consistently be that better version of myself and achieve
          the lifestyle I desired, I needed to start living a more structured
          and disciplined life. And instead of consistently reflecting and
          designing that lifestyle on a paper, I decided to implement my
          developing skills as a Software Engineer and build a desktop
          application to do just that.
